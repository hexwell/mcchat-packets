I want the following versions of mcchat-packets:
  - kt definition + manual serialization
  - annotated kt definition + runtime reflective serialization
  - annotated kt definition + generated serialization (KSP + kotlinpoet)
  - yaml definition + generated serialization (kotlinpoet)

- java annotation processing?
